# Example
4x Thermocouple Shield for Arduino Uno 

Compile and upload (Linux):

1) set the following environment variables:

PATH_TO_ARDUINO_IDE = /path/to/your/arduinoIDE

ARDUINO_IDE_VER = 1.6.X (or what your version is)

GITHUB_MIRROR = /path/to/your/github/mirror (optional, local github mirror, https://github.com is used per default)

2) connect Arduino Uno to PC via USB cable

3) execute the following commands:

\>make

\>make upload

\>make minicom

Make sure you have write permissions to /dev/ttyUSB0.

PCB can be build with toner transfer method easily. Only bottom layer needs to be etched, use wires for top layer.
